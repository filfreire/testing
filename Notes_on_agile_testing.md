# Agile Testing - notes

"Build quality into the product rather than trying to test it in later." - W. Eduards Deming

This is the heart of agile teams - build quality into the product.

### Critical commonalities:
- Programmers write and automate unit and integration tests? (good code coverage?)
- Discipline in the use of source code control and code integration;
- Skilled testers involved from the start of the development cycle;
- Skilled testers given adequate time and resources to test in all necessary forms of testing;
- An automated regression suite that covers the higher level system functionality is run and checked regularly;
- Team understands customers jobs and needs, works together with business experts.

### Some ideas
- People make projects sucessful. Not tools or methodologies.
- Everyone involved in delivering software is a developer.
- Working harder and longer doesn't help when your taksk is impossible to achieve.

### Traditional team:
- enforced gated phases of a narrowly defined software development life cycle, (...) usually ending with a rushed testing phase and a delayed release.
- leaders of quality assurance teams: expected to act as gatekeepers of quality.
- post-development testing phases expected to boost quality after code was complete;

### Doubts:
- How can we possibly code and test so quickly?
- Where would we find time for difficult efforts such as automating tests?
- What control do we have over bad code getting delivered to production?

Note: these notes are taken while studying the book Agile Testing.
